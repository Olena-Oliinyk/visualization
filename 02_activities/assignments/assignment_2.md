# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Good Visualization: Spare Time Over a Lifetime, Carni Klirs  
      https://www.carniklirs.com/project/spare-time-over-a-lifetime 
      
      Carni Klirs' Spare Time Over a Lifetime is an exemplary streamgraph that visualizes how an individual's leisure activities evolve with age. It translates complex time-based categorical data into a flowing, intuitive story. The design excels across the three essential qualities of visualization: aesthetic, substantive, and perceptual integrity, while maintaining accessibility and emotional engagement.
      
      Aesthetically, the visualization uses a cohesive, limited colour palette to distinguish activity types. Smooth, organic curves and consistent spacing support Gestalt principles of similarity and continuity, allowing the viewer to follow trends easily.  
      
      Substantively, the width of each stream encodes the amount of time devoted to an activity, making the quantitative message honest and clear. The alignment along a single age axis contextualizes changes across the life course, highlighting the transition from "childish pursuits" to "career skills".  
      
      Perceptually, the design guides attention naturally from left to right, reducing cognitive load (Leppink, 2017). Minimal annotation, strong colour contrast, and simple typography make the message immediately comprehensible.  
      
      Accessibility is supported through high contrast and bold labelling, ensuring readability even for audiences with mild visual impairments. The visualization also invites emotional connection, transforming personal data into a life story, illustrating that visualizations can be both factual and persuasive.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      1. Add numeric reference lines or tooltips for more precise quantitative reading.  
      2. Provide a short text caption or alt-text summary for accessibility and reproducibility.  
      3. Include explicit data source and method information to strengthen provenance rhetoric.  
      4. Consider an interactive version allowing users to isolate or highlight a specific activity over time without clutter.
      
      ```

      - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Bad Visualization: 3D Blocks Visualization, Stibo Systems  
      https://iibawards-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1410773546066-gji78q6pnl8fr-ba8214368d58b7250a54456d3ca4b33e%2FStibo-3D-blocks.mp4 
      
      This 3D bar chart by Stibo Systems demonstrates how unnecessary complexity and poor perceptual design can obscure information. While visually impressive, it violates several principles of effective visualization, clarity, honesty, and accessibility, outlined in Munzner's "Visualization Analysis and Design" (2014).

      Perceptual distortion:  
      The 3D perspective causes occlusion; some bars hide others, and apparent sizes vary depending on angle. This prevents accurate comparison of values. The angled axes exaggerate nearby bars and shrink distant ones, introducing visual bias.  
      
      Cognitive overload:  
      Three variables (brands, item type, data enrichment) are crammed into one frame, forcing viewers to mentally reconstruct depth, which adds extraneous cognitive load (Leppink, 2017). Shadows and gradients compound the problem.  
      
      Aesthetic and rhetorical issues:  
      Although sleek, the chart prioritizes form over function, violating Tufte's (1983) "data-ink ratio". The design projects authority but sacrifices interpretability, showing how visuals can persuade without clarity (Kennedy et al., 2016).  
      
      Accessibility:  
      Small text, low-contrast colours, and a skewed layout make it difficult for colour-blind or low-vision users. The 3D format is also incompatible with screen readers.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      1. Replace the 3D form with a 2D grouped or stacked bar chart to preserve perceptual accuracy.  
      2. Simplify to two variables (e.g., Item Type vs. Data Enrichment) and use colour or facets for the third.  
      3. Improve contrast using an accessible palette such as Viridis.  
      4. Label axes clearly and cite data sources to support reproducibility and trust.  
      
      By flattening the design and adhering to perceptual and accessibility principles, this visualization could communicate the same data transparently and effectively.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
